# KryptoTask'
1) The code Is actually pushed to Main branch So please check the code from master branch.

2)Functionalities :
  
  a)This application is built using React front end library.
  
  b)The application is sample of online shopping application
  
  c)I have tried to do most in provided time.
  
  d)When you open the site You will be redirected to the login page
  
  e)The login page does not contain any authentication so you can eneter anything and press login.
  
  f)the option for Products in header is clickable but not reachable, It will ask you to login first to see the products.
  
  g)after logging in you will directly land on the page of products, where each product is displayed in form of attractive component
  
  f)I have tried to make it's design very similar like the provided one. 
  
  g)The header maintains three buttons, Products, Logout and Cart along with the total number of products in the cart.
  
  h)Products will take you to product page, logout will head to login page, and cart will take you to the cart page. The cart button also shows the total number of           unique items in the cart. Suppose if there are 3 tshirts of same type it won't show you 3 but will show you 1.
  
  i)Now coming to Products page. This page consist of templates, each conatining different item. The template has the option to add the item to the cart.
  
  j)When we add the items to the cart the number on header beside cart option will increase.
  
  k)once you go to cart you can checkout and confirm the order.
  
  l)I have build this application in really less time since we are having exam at 7am in the morning next day, so couldn't complete as expected.
 
3)Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

Yes, there are some improvements i would love to do if i had enough time.

a)It would have been cooler if item were handled in cart also (add and remove).It is really easy from the current position to implement this. 
Due to time constraint and other placement ativities the next day, I have tried to achieve maximum friom the given time.
